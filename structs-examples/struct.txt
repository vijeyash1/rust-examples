Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By 
using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other 
and name each piece to make your code clear. Methods let you specify the 
behavior that instances of your structs have, and associated functions let you 
namespace functionality that is particular to your struct without having an 
instance available.
